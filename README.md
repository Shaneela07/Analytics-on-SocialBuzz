** INTRODUCTION :**
* This is Accenture North America & Forage job simulation program for a client named Social Buzz.
* Social Buzz emphasizes content creation and social media platform , which tracking user reactions on every piece of content.
There are over 100 ways that users can react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. 
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user feeds. 
Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. 
They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee 
their scaling process effectively. 
Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they 
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging 
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and 
requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 
250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this 
highly complex technology. 
Up until this point, they have not relied on any third party firms to help them get to where 
they are. However there are 3 main reasons why they are now looking at bringing in external
expertise: 
1) They are looking to complete an IPO by the end of next year and need guidance to 
ensure that this goes smoothly. 
2) They are still a small company and do not have the resources to manage the scale that 
they are currently at. They could hire more people, but they want an experienced 
practice to help instead.
3) They want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of 
their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on understanding how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big 
data. 
To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order 
to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following: 
- An audit of their big data practice 
- Recommendations for a successful IPO 
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the 
largest aggregate popularity.
